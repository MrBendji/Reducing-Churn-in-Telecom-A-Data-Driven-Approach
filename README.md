# Reducing Churn in Telecom: A Data-Driven Approach

**Problem Statement:**

In the highly competitive telecommunications industry, customer churn remains a significant challenge for service providers. Churn, defined as the rate at which customers discontinue their services, not only results in revenue loss but also imposes additional costs associated with acquiring new customers to replace those who leave.



**Objectives:**

The primary objective of this project is to leverage data analytics and machine learning to address the issue of customer churn in the telecom industry, using the dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data). Specifically, our goals are as follows:

1. Develop a predictive model: Build a machine learning model capable of predicting which customers are likely to churn in the near future.

2. Improve customer retention: Implement targeted retention strategies based on the model's predictions to reduce churn rates and increase customer loyalty.

3. Optimize resources: By accurately identifying customers at risk of churn, we aim to optimize resource allocation and reduce customer acquisition costs.


By achieving these objectives, telecom company aims to enhance customer satisfaction, increase revenue stability, and strengthen its competitive position in the market.
